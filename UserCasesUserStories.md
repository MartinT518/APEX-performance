COACH: User Stories & Use Cases SpecificationSource: 
COACH_Apex_OS_PRD_FRD_v2_3.mdContext: "Zero-Error" Logic ImplementationVersion: 1.01. 

ACTORS & PERSONAS
The High-Rev Athlete (User): An outlier physiology (e.g., 183bpm Threshold). Frustrated by standard apps calling them "Anaerobic." Highly motivated but injury-prone ("Phoenix").
The Coach Agent (System): The central reasoning engine that arbitrates between safety and performance.
The Micro-Agents (System): Specialized background processes (Structural, Metabolic, Fueling) that audit specific risks.
2. USE CASE: ONBOARDING & PHENOTYPE (Module M)
3. Goal: Establish the "Ground Truth" so the system does not flag valid data as errors.
Story 1.1: Phenotype ConfigurationAs a High-Rev Athlete,I want to manually override my Max HR and toggle "High-Rev Phenotype" mode,So that the system validates my 180bpm steady-state runs as "Threshold" instead of discarding them as "Sensor Artifacts."Acceptance Criteria:User can input specific Max_HR (e.g., 205).User can toggle is_high_rev_phenotype.System acknowledges: "Phenotype Locked. Standard Anomaly Detection Disabled.
Story 1.2: Structural Baseline SetupAs a "Phoenix" Athlete (Post-Injury),I want to define my "Mandatory Strength Frequency" (e.g., 2x/week),So that the Structural Agent knows when to trigger a Veto for missing chassis maintenance.Acceptance Criteria:Input field for Required_Lift_Days_Per_Week.Input field for Injury_History (e.g., "Patellar Tendon").3. USE CASE: ACTIVE INGESTION (Module M)Goal: Capture the "Hidden Variables" (Pain, Strength, Gut) before the algorithm runs.Story 2.1: The "Gatekeeper" Daily PromptAs a User starting my day,I want to be prompted for my "Niggle Score" (0-10) via a slider,So that the system can immediately calculate my Structural Risk before showing me a plan.Acceptance Criteria:Slider ranges 0 (No Pain) to 10 (Agony).If Score > 3, UI changes color to Amber/Red immediately.This input must block the view of the Daily Workout until completed.Story 2.2: Active Strength LoggingAs a User who trains in a gym,I want to log my heavy lifting session with a specific "Tonnage Tier" (Maintenance vs. Power),So that the Structural Agent credits my "Chassis Integrity" score.Acceptance Criteria:Simple toggle: "Did you lift?" (Yes/No).If Yes, select intensity: "Mobility" (Low), "Hypertrophy" (Med), "Strength/Power" (High).System updates Days_Since_Lift counter to 0.Story 2.3: The Fueling Audit (Post-Run)As a Marathoner finishing a long run (>90 mins),I want to input my "Carbs Per Hour" and "GI Distress Rating",So that the Fueling Agent can track if my gut is trained for the sub-2:30 attempt.Acceptance Criteria:Trigger only fires if Session_Duration > 90 min.Input: Carbs_Grams (Numeric).Input: GI_Rating (1-5 Stars).Failure to log results in a "Fueling Blindspot" warning on the dashboard.4. USE CASE: SIGNAL PROCESSING (Module K)Goal: Backend filtering to ensure data integrity.Story 3.1: Cadence Lock DetectionAs a User with an optical heart rate monitor,I want the system to automatically discard heart rate data if it matches my cadence for >5 minutes,So that the Metabolic Agent doesn't think I was in Zone 5 when I was actually jogging.Acceptance Criteria:System detects Correlation(HR, Cadence) > 0.95.UI displays: "HR Data Invalidated (Cadence Lock). Analyzing via Pace/Power."5. USE CASE: DAILY PLAN EXECUTION (Module E & R)Goal: The "Go/No-Go" Decision and Substitution.Story 4.1: The "Green Light" PlanAs a Healthy Athlete (All Agents Green),I want to see my original Blueprint workout (e.g., "15km Threshold"),So that I can execute the high-performance training.Acceptance Criteria:Dashboard shows "STATUS: GO".Agent Summary shows: Structural (Green), Metabolic (Green), Fueling (Green).Story 4.2: The "Structural Veto" (Substitution)As a User with a niggle (Score 4) or missing strength work,I want the system to automatically replace my Running Intervals with Cycling Intervals (matching duration/intensity),So that I maintain my metabolic engine without stressing my connective tissue.Acceptance Criteria:Input: Niggle = 4.System Logic: Triggers Substitution_Matrix.Output: Workout changes from "Run" to "Bike" or "BFR Walk".Explanation Text: "Engine is ready, but Chassis reported pain. Switched to Non-Impact to preserve fitness."Story 4.3: The "Metabolic Veto" (Downgrade)As a User showing signs of physiological burnout (HRV tanked, High HR Drift),I want the system to downgrade my Threshold Run to a Zone 1 Recovery Run,So that I can absorb previous training instead of digging a deeper hole.Acceptance Criteria:Input: HRV < Baseline - 15%.Output: Workout changes to "45 min Zone 1" or "Rest".Explanation Text: "Systemic Fatigue detected. Intensity removed to allow supercompensation."Story 4.4: The "Fueling Veto" (Cap)As a User with an untrained gut (Low Fueling Index),I want the system to cap my Long Run duration at 2 hours,So that I avoid a disastrous "bonk" or metabolic crash during training.Acceptance Criteria:Input: Gut_Index = Low.Output: Long Run shortened from 32km to 24km.Action Item: "Add 5 min surges to simulate fatigue without glycogen depletion."6. USE CASE: LONG-TERM STRATEGY (Module A)Goal: Forecasting and Confidence.Story 5.1: The Certainty ScoreAs a Goal-Oriented Athlete,I want to see a probability score (e.g., "82% Certainty") of achieving my Sub-2:30 goal,So that I understand the real-world impact of my adherence.Acceptance Criteria:Score updates daily based on Monte Carlo simulation.Visual trend line showing Certainty over time.Explanation: "Certainty dropped 2% due to substituted Bike session (Specific Economy Loss)."Story 5.2: The Chassis Integrity DashboardAs a User focusing on injury prevention,I want to see a visual correlation between my "Tonnage Lifted" and my "Running Volume,"So that I can visually confirm that my Chassis is strong enough to support my Engine.Acceptance Criteria:Dual-axis chart: Bar (Strength Tonnage) vs. Line (Run Volume)."Safe Zone" indicator where Tonnage > Volume Ratio.7. USE CASE: AUDIT & EXPLAINABILITY (Module R)Goal: Trust and Transparency.Story 6.1: The Decision LogAs a User who is confused why my run was canceled,I want to see exactly which Agent voted "RED" and why,So that I trust the system's judgment over my own ego.Acceptance Criteria:"Why this plan?" button on the dashboard.Pop-up displays Agent Votes:Structural: RED (Reason: Pain > 3).Metabolic: GREEN.Recovery: AMBER (Reason: Sleep < 6h).
